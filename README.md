over view of the project:


roles and responsibilities:
  




  Data collection:
      1.Import the data into Mysql server through data import into one database .

how :
  server--data import--start import


 --Used different commands like DDl,DML,DCL for different query execution.
 
 SQL JOINS:
   --Joints are used to  combine the  two or more tables through using the common column in the  two tables.
   --They are different joins like Inner,Left,Right and cross.
   --But in this project mostly used the inner join.
   --Helps normalize database structure.
   --Improves query efficiency by retrieving related data in a single operation.
   --Enhances data consistency and avoids data redundancy.

  stored procedure:
      --A Stored Procedure is a set of SQL statements that are saved and executed as a single unit. 
      --It allows for better performance, reusability, and security
      --It is stored in the database and Can be executed multiple times with different parameters.
      --Grants execution rights without exposing table structures.
      
  common table expression(cte):
    --A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. 
    --It makes queries more readable 
    --simplifies complex queries by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts.
    -- It is not stored in the database and we need to use in the that session.

  window functions:
    --These functions are powerful for tasks like running totals, moving averages, and comparison of current and previous row values.
    -- rank(),row_number(),dense_rank() these are the different window functions.
    -- mainly used in the schools and colleages to know about toppers  in the exams.

conclusion: 
 The analysis provides valuable insights into Croma India's monthly and yearly sales, helping track product performance, customer contribution, and market trends. The use of SQL joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Stored Procedures enhances efficiency and scalability in querying large datasets. The report highlights top-performing markets, customers, and products, allowing strategic decision-making for future growth and risk mitigation.
